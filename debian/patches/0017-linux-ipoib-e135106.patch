Description: factor out ah flushing
 From linux e135106:
 .
 Create a an ipoib_flush_ah and ipoib_stop_ah routines to use at
 appropriate times to flush out all remaining ah entries before we shut
 the device down.
 .
 Because neighbors and mcast entries can each have a reference on any
 given ah, we must make sure to free all of those first before our ah
 will actually have a 0 refcount and be able to be reaped.
 .
 This factoring is needed in preparation for having per-device work
 queues.  The original per-device workqueue code resulted in the following
 error message:
 .
 <ibdev>: ib_dealloc_pd failed
 .
 That error was tracked down to this issue.  With the changes to which
 workqueues were flushed when, there were no flushes of the per device
 workqueue after the last ah's were freed, resulting in an attempt to
 dealloc the pd with outstanding resources still allocated.  This code
 puts the explicit flushes in the needed places to avoid that problem.
 .
