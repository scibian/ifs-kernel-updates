Description: Make sendonly multicast joins create the mcast group
 From linux c3852ab:
 .
 Since IPoIB should, as much as possible, emulate how multicast
 sends work on Ethernet for regular TCP/IP apps, there should be
 no requirement to subscribe to a multicast group before your
 sends are properly sent.  However, due to the difference in how
 multicast is handled on InfiniBand, we must join the appropriate
 multicast group before we can send to it.  Previously we tried
 not to trigger the auto-create feature of the subnet manager when
 doing this because we didn't have tracking of these sendonly
 groups and the auto-creation might never get undone.  The previous
 patch added timing to these sendonly joins and allows us to
 leave them after a reasonable idle expiration time.  So supply
 all of the information needed to auto-create group.
