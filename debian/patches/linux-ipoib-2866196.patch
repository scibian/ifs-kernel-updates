Description: increase the max mcast backlog queue
 From linux 2866196:
 .
 When performing sendonly joins, we queue the packets that trigger
 the join until the join completes.  This may take on the order of
 hundreds of milliseconds.  It is easy to have many more than three
 packets come in during that time.  Expand the maximum queue depth
 in order to try and prevent dropped packets during the time it
 takes to join the multicast group.
